# Inventory Tracker

By _**Kyle Chinick**_

## Description

This app tracks user inventory of products.

A user can create a new product via a form, can change that product via a seperate form (that makes use of the new product form template), and can delete a product.

Additionally, users have the ability to sell a single unit of the selected product which causes that product's quantity to decrease by 1 unit.
