# Inventory Tracker

By _**Kyle Chinick**_

## Description

This app tracks user inventory of products.

A user can create a new product via a form, can change that product via a seperate form (that makes use of the new product form template), and can delete a product.

Additionally, users have the ability to sell a single unit of the selected product which causes that product's quantity to decrease by 1 unit. _NOTE: this feature is still in development, the current version of this app will reflect the quantity decrease only in the console._

## Known Bugs

- The decrement feature for selling a single unit of inventory functions partially as intended â€“ causing the selected product to decrement but does not add the modified product to a new/current state.
  - This results in being able to see the quantity change in the console only.
  - Also because of not currently having the updated value set to a new state repeatedly clicking the "sell" button will infinitely decrement the inventory item from X to X-1 since without the new state the function repeatedly re-references the original quantity to decrement).
